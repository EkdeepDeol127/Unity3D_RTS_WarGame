This is my final build of this project for MILESTONE 3, I got everything I wanted to get In the Game and am happy with how it turned out, 
All I am missing are finial assets and few bugs that don't break the game but are annoying.

Inputs: 
	ASWD keys to move around, also dragging mouse to edge of map to move
	ScrollWheel is used to zoom in and out
	Hold RightMouseButton to rotate around
	Click with the MiddleMouseButton to move the units
	Click with the LeftMouseButton to select units
	Click with the RightMouseButton to rotate camera
	Move the MouseArrow to the edges of the screen to move camera, also WSAD has same functionality(inverted if facing backwards)//bug
	Use Shift to also see functionality for selecting units, basic to RTS Games
	Use Esc to open in game menu
	
Incomplete:	
	I have everthing I wanted to add, besides final assets.

Bugs: 	
	Units don't fire right away when spawned and have to move away from enemy then back to fire
	Units can fire through walls, can be fixed with a simple ray cast to see if enemy is in sight or behind wall, before firing
	Camera controls are inverted when facing backwards
	Unit select can select more units if not all in selection box 

Cheats:
	Use N to go to the win screen if you suck to bad at the game
	Use L to go to the lose screen
